the teachers say that 'the index.md in practical should be different from rob's page!' but mine is the same as rob's page, so I change the context of index.md
I aslo make the Commit messages for Week 4 are informative change from '145' tp 'practical 4'
for practical 5, I have stop the loop when finding the first number <=50 and I fixed the erro called 'SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal, can be fixed by putting ",n) at the end of the print statement' by using str() to change integers into strings
for practical 6, I made title for each gragh and dislay frequency table.
I found I have known better about the git, python and other softwares. I have corrected my code after the feedback.Through this process, I have enchanced my ability to write code.

This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored
